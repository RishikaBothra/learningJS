let in `JavaScript` is used to declare a variable. It is similar to `var` but has some differences.

```javascript
let name = "Rishika";

console.log("Hello " + name + "!");
```

`const` keyword in `JavaScript` is used to declare a constant variable. The value of a constant variable cannot be changed once it is assigned.

```javascript
const name = "Rishika";
name = "Aditya";

console.log("Hello " + name + "!");
```
